## Thought Process

### Predicting House Prices / Rental Growth in Towns Across Long Island

Language Used: Python  
Scope: 2019: 4% avg, 2021: 3% avg
2021 $350,000 2%
2023: $450,000 6.5%

How does this demand impact rental prices as well?  
2020: $1400  
2023: $2000

If Interest Rates fell: How much would prices go up Based off of 2021 (When interest rates fell from 5% to 2%)  
If Interest Rates remain the same (or even go up): What would happen to home prices, versus demand for them?
